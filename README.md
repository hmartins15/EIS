Work developed during the course on electronics and telecommunications engineering (Universidade de Aveiro). This one, was done in the class of Electronic Instrumentation Systems in the 4th year (2018/2019).

* /*Examples*/
In the folder MicrocontrollerExemple-master there is the code which served, as a example, to develop the functions of the LCD. Thanks to the developer, it was a big help. Link: https://github.com/andrade824/Microcontroller-Example-Code 


* /*Info/Reports*/
